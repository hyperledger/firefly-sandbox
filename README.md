This is an API exerciser and prototyping tool for applications that communicate with FireFly.

### Dashboard

## Running with CLI

As of v0.0.47 of the [firefly-cli](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-cli), one instance
of the sandbox will be started by default for each member of your local FireFly network.
Simply initialize a new stack with the default parameters, and you'll be able to explore and
exercise it using the sandbox.

## Running manually

To run the application manually, start the server and the UI:

```
cd server
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

```
cd ui
npm install
npm start
```

Note: If your Firefly instance is not exposed on port 5000 locally or running remotely, set the env FF_ENDPOINT to the location of your instance.
